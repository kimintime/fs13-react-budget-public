This is a very simple Budget App, that tracks deposits and expenses, allows transfer to savings, and setting target savings goals, showing the percentage of that goal saved. It can also show and hide an ongoing list of transactions.

## How to Use

1. Enter a transactions amount. Descrption and Date are optional, but you must choose Expense or Deposite type from the drop-down menu.

2. The current balance shows how much you have. You have to entire valid numbers in order to enter transactions, or transfer to savings, and the app will alert and prevent a negative balance.

3. Hit Reset on the Savings to reset the goal to zero, and to transfer the Savings amount back to the balance.

## About

1. The savings and balance are kept separate, as in a real-world checkings and savings scenario, where seeing a total balance of what's in all accounts when withdrawing for expenses would not be helpful.

2. However, it is possible to put the savings back to the current balance by resetting the savings and target goal. The target can be modified this way at anytime.

3. As time allows, the ability to edit and delete transactions from the list is an upcoming feature.
